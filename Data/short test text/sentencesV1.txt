Benny and Roni are baking a pizza in my house
i walk through the black looking glass
last night my sister eat white meat
Sal listen his favorite song
Craig hit the baseball over the fence
The little pig grunt
The house roof is leaking
The hunter search for deer
Dr. Gold examine his patient
The bluebird in the tree sing beautifully
The football team dash out from the locker room
Paul read The Tom Sawyer Adventures book 
Mrs. Gray buy paper towels roll at the store
Judy solve the mystery
Harold find  purple crayon
Fred eat the sweets
He love them
Sara stop the car
Fred want  new car
He drive much too fast
Buses can carry more people than cars
usually I walk toward the office
They eat lunch very quickly
We watch  brilliant film yesterday
Jo often wear jeans
We go toward the fish with chip shop
I have chicken with chips with mushy peas
The gate creak in the wind
It feel much warmer today
